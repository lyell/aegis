* Introduction
================================================================================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the Aegis C++ Library. Aegis is
a software library that can be used to create robust, error-free,
high-performance applications. Although the library contains a number of
elements that are geared for game programming, all of the core elements are
useful for any type of application. The foundation components, combined with
the concurrency and networking components provide the basic building blocks
for the most common types of applications a developer may wish to create.
